# mono:di

Mono:di is an [MEI](http://music-encoding.org/) editor used for the transcription of medieval monophonic music. [Try the demo!](https://monodi.corpus-monodicum.de/)


## Why was mono:di developed?

[Corpus monodicum](http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-wuerzburg.de/forschung/corpus_monodicum/) needed an input solution for data that can both be used in the creation of printed and digital open access music editions. In contrast to existing notation software, mono:di provides

* semantically useful MEI data
* support for the special form of notation used by the project
* a ready-to-use system where researchers, editors and assistants don't have to license and install software individually
* functionality of a collaborative content management system
* built-in version control.


## What is mono:di's future?

As of 2017, we are planning a development phase to meet requirements that emerged during the editorial and production work.

Large parts of mono:di are independent of the specific type of notation used by Corpus monodicum. This means, adjustments for projects with other notation and encoding requirements are feasible.
